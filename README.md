 RAG STUDIO PIPELINE OVERVIEW
====================
A high-level, actionable summary of the app's main logic and flow for junior developers.
-->
## RAG Studio Pipeline Overview

The application consists of two main components:
1. **Frontend (UI)**: Built with Streamlit, this is the user-facing application where you configure your RAG pipeline.
   - **Data Section**: Define your data sources (e.g., documents, PDFs, text files).
   - **Indexing & Storage**: Set up your vector store (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB) to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings.
   - **Retrieval & Reranking**: Configure how to retrieve relevant documents and re-rank them for better quality.
   - **Generation & Prompting**: Define your prompt templates and generation strategy.
   - **Model Management**: Choose and configure your language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) for generation.
   - **Evaluation**: Measure the performance of your RAG system using metrics like MRR, MAP, and ROUGE.

2. **Backend (RAG Pipeline)**: The logic that runs in the background, handling data ingestion, embedding generation, retrieval, and generation.
   - **Data Ingestion**: Load and process your documents (e.g., chunking, cleaning, embedding).
   - **Indexing**: Store embeddings in your vector store.
   - **Retrieval**: Use your vector store to find relevant documents.
   - **Reranking**: Re-rank retrieved documents to improve the quality of the final answer.
   - **Generation**: Use your language model to generate the final answer based on the retrieved and re-ranked documents.

The app provides a user-friendly interface to configure these components and monitor their performance.

====================
Explain prerequisites, installation, and quickstart. This helps new users get up and running fast.
-->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OS: Windows, MacOS, or Linux
- (Optional) [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for UI

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quickstart
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

<!--
====================
 USAGE
====================
Step-by-step guide for using the app. Add more details as needed.
-->
## Usage
1. Start with the Data section to configure your data sources
2. Move to Indexing & Storage to set up your vector store
3. Configure Retrieval & Reranking parameters
4. Set up your prompting strategy
5. Choose and configure your models
6. Use the Evaluation section to measure performance

 PROJECT STRUCTURE
====================
Briefly explain the main files and folders. This helps users understand where to look for things.
-->
## Project Structure
```
rag_studio/
  app.py                # Main Streamlit app
  backend.py            # Backend logic for RAG pipeline
  data/                 # Data, embeddings, evaluation sets, vector stores
  prompts/              # Prompt templates
  requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
  README.md             # This file
```

<!--
====================
 CONFIGURATION
====================
Explain how to configure models, data sources, and environment variables.
-->
## Configuration
- Edit `app.py` and `backend.py` to set model parameters, data paths, and other options.
- Place your data and embeddings in the `data/` directory.
- (Optional) Use environment variables for API keys and secrets.

<!--
====================
 ARCHITECTURE
====================
Describe the system design. Add a diagram if possible.
-->
## Architecture
The application follows a modular design with separate sections for each major component of the RAG pipeline. The UI is built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive interface.

<!--
You can add a diagram here using Mermaid or an image:


  Data-->Indexing;
  Indexing-->Retrieval;
  Retrieval-->Generation;
  Generation-->Evaluation;

-->

<!--
====================
 EVALUATION & BENCHMARKS
====================
Show how to evaluate the system and any benchmark results.
-->
## Evaluation & Benchmarks
- Use the Evaluation section in the app to measure performance.
- Results are saved in `data/evaluation/results/`.
