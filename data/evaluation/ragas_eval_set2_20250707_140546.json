      "The classical automated reasoning literature has shown that reasoning in the backward direction (i.e. from the intended conclusion to supporting axioms) is significantly more efficient at proof-finding. Importing this intuition into the LM setting, we develop a Backward Chaining algorithm, called LAMBADA , that decomposes reasoning into four sub-modules."

    ],
    "answer": [
      "The two main approaches to logical reasoning are Forward Chaining (FC) and Backward Chaining (BC). Forward Chaining starts from the facts and rules (the \"theory\"), making new inferences until the goal is proved or disproved. Backward Chaining, conversely, starts from the goal and recursively breaks it down into sub-goals until they can be proved or disproved based on the theory."

    "contexts": [
      "According to the results, we observe that whenever LAMBADA predicts PROVED or DISPROVED , the prediction is mostly correct. The accuracy is slightly more on cases where the prediction is PROVED than DISPROVED . We believe this is because DISPROVED cases typically involve negation that makes the reasoning more complex. However, there are several examples for which the label is PROVED or DISPROVED , whereas the model predicts UNKNOWN ."
